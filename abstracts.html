    <h3><font color="#0000aa"><a name="lawder00th"> The Application of

	  Multi-Dimensional Data.</a></h3></font> J.K.Lawder<br> PhD Thesis

    <p>Indexing of multi-dimensional data has been the focus of a
    considerable amount of research effort over many years but no
    generally agreed paradigm has emerged to compare with the impact
    of the B-Tree, for example, on the indexing of one-dimensional
    data. At the same time, the need for efficient methods is ever
    more important in an environment where databases become larger and
    more complex in their structures.</p>

    <p>Mapping multi-dimensional data to one dimension, thus enabling
    one-dimensional access methods to be exploited, has been suggested
    in the literature but for the most part interest has been confined
    to the Z-order curve. The possibility of using other curves, such
    as the Hilbert and Gray-code curves, whose characteristics differ
    from those of the Z-order curve, has also been suggested.</p>

    <p>In this thesis we design and implement a working file store
    which is underpinned by the principle of mapping multi-dimensional
    data to one of a variety of space-filling curves and their
    variants. Data is then indexed using a B+ Tree which remains
    compact, regardless of the volume and number of dimensions. The
    implementation has entailed developing algorithms for mapping data
    to one dimension and, most importantly, developing algorithms to
    facilitate the querying of data in a flexible way. We focus on the
    Hilbert curve but also consider other curves and propose new
    alternative algorithms for querying data mapped to the Z-order
    curve.</p>

    <p>The current implementation accommodates data in up to sixteen
    dimensions but the approach is generic and not limited to this
    number. We report on preliminary testing of the implemetation,
    which provides very encouraging results. We also undertake a brief
    exploration of the application of space-filling curves to the
    indexing of spatial data.</p>

    <p>This paper presents and discusses a radically different
    approach to multi-dimensional indexing based on the concept of the
    space-filling curve.  It reports the novel algorithms which had to
    be developed to create the first actual implementation of a system
    based on this approach, on some comparative performance tests, and
    on its actual use within the TriStarp Group at Birkbeck to provide
    a Triple Store repository. An important result that goes beyond
    this requirement, however, is that the performance improvement
    over the Grid File is greater the higher the dimension.</p>

	Mapping to one-dimensional values and then using a one-dimensional indexing method
	has been proposed as a way of indexing multi-dimensional data. Most previous related
	work uses the Z-Order Curve but more recently the Hilbert Curve has been considered
	since it has superior clustering properties. Any approach, however, can only be of
	practical value if there are effective methods for executing range and partial match
	queries. This paper describes such a method for the Hilbert Curve.

	The Hilbert Curve describes a method of mapping between one and $n$ 
	dimensions. Such mappings are of interest in a number of application domains 
	including image processing and, more recently, in the indexing of 
	multi-dimensional data. Relatively little work, however, has been devoted to 
	techniques for mapping in more that 2 dimensions. This paper presents a 
	technique for constructing state diagrams to facilitate mappings and is a 
	specialization of an incomplete generic process described by Bially. Although 
	the storage requirements for state diagrams increase exponentially with the 
	number of dimensions, they are useful in up to about 9 dimensions.

	This report reproduces and briefly discusses an algorithm proposed by
	Butz for calculating a mapping between one-dimensional values
	and n-dimensional values regarded as being the coordinates of points lying
	on Hilbert Curves. It suggests some practical improvements to the algorithm
	and presents an algorithm for calculating the inverse of the mapping, from
	n-dimensional values to one-dimensional values.
