# Hilbert-Curve

This repository contains files relating to PhD research completed in 2000 into the application of space-filling curves in the storage and retrieval of multi-dimensional data from databases. This research was carried out at Birkbeck College, University of London, UK.

Though relating to space-filling curves in general, the research placed a particular emphasis on the Hilbert Curve. It developed algorithms for point and range queries for multi-dimensional data mapped to positions on the Hilbert Curve. The Hilbert Curve has particularly interesting properties in that, to a greater extent than other curves, points that are close to each other in space tend to be closer in their sequence along the Hilbert Curve. This helps to cluster data within a database that is close to each other in multi-dimensional space, thus facilitating more efficient retrieval.
